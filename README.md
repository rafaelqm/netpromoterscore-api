# Project NPS API

## Simple project in Typescript and NodeJS

This is a NodeJS API to save the score of an product or company 
and calculate the Net Promoter Score (NPS)

## Docker ready
To avoid the need to install Node in version 12.18.4, it comes a docker-compose.yml file,
so just run the docker compose and inside bash run the **npm start**.

```
docker-compose run --rm --service-ports dev
```
